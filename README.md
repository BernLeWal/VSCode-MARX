# Markdown Explorer (MARX) - VSCode Extension 

The Markdown Explorer is an VSCode extension which will plug in to the view-bar to show the directory hierarchy and the Markdown-Files (.md) only.
Together with the MARP-Extension it allows to use the file-system directory structure together with Markdown-files to be used as knowledge-base, e.g. as an alternative to OneNote.
The benefit is, that VCS can be used to track file changes and the storage is on your own machine.

- Additional MARX Symbol in the activation bar to open the Markdown Explorer view
- Markdown-Explorer view, showing the directory hierarchy and Markdown-files (.md) only.

## Requirements
